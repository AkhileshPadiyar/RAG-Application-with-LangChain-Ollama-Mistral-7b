RAG Application with LangChain & Ollama Mistral:7b
Overview
This project presents a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to answer user queries by retrieving information from a local text file and then generating responses using a large language model. Built with LangChain, this application demonstrates an effective way to ground LLM responses in specific documentation, minimizing factual inaccuracies and hallucinations.

The application utilizes the Ollama mistral:7b open-source model for its reasoning capabilities, providing a powerful yet locally runnable solution for contextual question answering.

How It Works
The core workflow of this RAG application is as follows:

Document Ingestion:

The application first reads and processes the content of a designated sample.txt file.

This content is then used to create a searchable knowledge base (e.g., by embedding the text and storing it in a vector database, though the specifics of the vector store are abstracted by LangChain).

Intelligent Retrieval:

When a user submits a query, the system performs a similarity search against the created knowledge base.

It intelligently identifies and retrieves the most relevant chunks of information from the original sample.txt document that pertain to the user's question.

Contextual Generation:

The retrieved relevant context is then passed along with the user's original query to the mistral:7b model (hosted via Ollama).

The mistral:7b model, using its advanced reasoning capabilities, generates a precise, comprehensive, and contextually informed answer, ensuring that the response is directly supported by the sample.txt content.

Features
Contextual Q&A: Provides answers directly derived from the provided sample.txt document.

LangChain Integration: Utilizes the LangChain framework for efficient RAG pipeline construction.

Ollama mistral:7b: Employs a powerful, open-source large language model for response generation.

Local Execution: Designed to run locally using Ollama, offering privacy and control over your LLM.

Simple Setup: Easy to configure and test with a single input file.

Prerequisites
Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+

Ollama: Install Ollama from ollama.ai and pull the mistral:7b model:

ollama pull mistral:7b

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file with langchain, ollama, pydantic, sentence-transformers (or other embedding model library), etc.)

Usage
Prepare your sample.txt file:
Place your text content in a file named sample.txt in the root directory of the project. This file will be the source of information for your RAG application.

Run the application:
(Assuming you have a Python script like app.py that sets up the RAG chain and handles queries)

python app.py

Follow the prompts to enter your queries.

## The History of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field that has captured the imagination of scientists and the public alike. Its origins can be traced back to the 1950s, a period marked by significant breakthroughs in computer science. John McCarthy, a prominent computer scientist, coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, often considered the birth of AI as a field.

Early AI research focused on problem-solving and symbolic methods, attempting to replicate human-like reasoning through logic and rule-based systems. Expert systems, which encapsulated knowledge from human experts, were a popular application in the 1970s and 80s. However, these systems often struggled with ambiguity and real-world complexity.

The 21st century has seen a resurgence in AI, largely driven by advancements in machine learning, particularly deep learning. This approach, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, uses neural networks to learn from vast amounts of data. Deep learning has led to remarkable progress in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing, making AI more practical and pervasive in daily life.

Example Queries
Based on the sample.txt above, you can test with queries like:

"Who coined the term Artificial Intelligence?"

"What was the focus of early AI research?"

"What advancements led to the resurgence of AI in the 21st century?"

"Name some areas where deep learning has made progress."
